► Step 1: DSA Foundations (Months 1–4) 
- Focus on core patterns: Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, DP 
- Use curated lists (200–250 questions across topics) 
- Learn Pattern-Based
- Weekly contests on LeetCode
- Build a revision sheet: your own distilled learnings, not just solutions 
- Target: 1.5-2 focused hrs daily with consistent tracking

Also, if you need help getting prepared for all the above things, like DSA, Development,and System Design under one guide, I’ve come out with amazing resource for you: https://bit.ly/3EISvLj


► Step 2: Frontend Development (Months 5–6)

Core Skills: 
— HTML + CSS (Responsive Layouts, Flex, Grid) 
— JavaScript (Closures, Async/Await, Event Loop) 
— Modern JS (ES6+, Promises, Fetch API, Modules)

React (or Vue/Angular): 
— Hooks, Routing, Context API 
— Component structure & state management 
— Real-world project structure

Advanced Layer: 
— Build tools (Vite/Webpack) 
— Unit testing (Jest/RTL) 
— Performance profiling + Lighthouse 
— Machine Coding Rounds (low-level DOM manipulation, sorting tables, building modals, etc.)


► Step 3: Backend Development in Java (Months 7–8)

Don’t just learn Spring Boot. 
Understand how things work.

Java Fundamentals: 
— Core Java, OOP, Collections, Exception Handling 
— Multithreading + JVM basics 
— Writing clean, testable code

Spring Boot Ecosystem: 
— REST APIs, Controllers, Services, Repositories 
— Spring Security (JWT, OAuth2) 
— JPA + Hibernate for DB integration 
— Exception Handling, Validation, Pagination

Dev Ready Add-ons: 
— Swagger docs 
— Docker basics 
— CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions / Jenkins) 
— JUnit & Integration Testing 
— Real-world machine coding: Authentication flows, file uploads, CRUD APIs


► Step 4: Combine & Build Full-Stack Projects (Month 8–9) 
- Pick 2–3 strong ideas (e.g. job board, project tracker, internal dashboard) 
- Frontend: React UI with routes, auth, dynamic states 
- Backend: Secure APIs, integrated with the frontend 
- Use PostgreSQL / MySQL, and deploy to Render / Vercel / Railway 
- Show off with a clean GitHub + README + LinkedIn post


► Step 5: LLD + System Design (parallel during Month 7–8) 
- Learn how to structure services, API contracts, DB schema 
- Start with Low-Level Design: Rate limiter, BookMyShow, Splitwise 
- HLD basics: Caching, Load Balancing, DB scaling (read-replicas)


► Step 6: Resume, Outreach & Interviews (Month 9 onwards) 
- Resume: Highlight projects + role-specific impact 
- Cold outreach: 40-50 targeted messages/week 
- Practice mock interviews weekly 
- Keep applying consistently, don’t rely on one channel
